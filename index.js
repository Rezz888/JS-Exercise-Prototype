  TASK 1
    - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
    - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

    - STRETCH: A car which runs out of `fuel` while driving can't drive any more distance:
        + The `drive` method should return a string "I ran out of fuel at x miles!" x being `odometer`.

  TASK 3
    - Write a Baby constructor subclassing Person.
    - Besides `name` and `age`, Baby takes a third argument to initialize `favoriteToy`.

  TASK 4

  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:

  1. Window/Global Object Binding
   - In most cases, the value of this is determined by how a function is called (runtime binding). It can't be set by assignment during execution, and it may be different each time the function is called. In most cases, the value of this is determined by how a function is called (runtime binding). It can't be set by assignment during execution, and it may be different each time the function is called. The use case of this principle is very rare.

  2. Implicit Binding
   - This principle is the best use case scenario for 'this'. here 'this' refers to what comes before the dot (.). In other words, when we run a method that has 'this' in it, this will refer to what comes before the dot.


  3. New binding
  - When we call function with a 'new' binding, 'this' will refer to an object which eventually be returned. 'This' becomes the instance that will be returned by the function.

  4. Explicit binding
  - Whenever we use JavaScriptâ€™s call or apply method, this is explicitly defined.
